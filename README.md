## 👨‍💼 About Me 

I am an enthusiastic data scientist committed to converting complex data into meaningful insights and actionable decisions. I am currently deepening my expertise in Predictive Analytics, Financial Risk Management, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Big Data Analytics. 

I have applied a broad range of methodologies in my projects, including but not limited to Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Ensemble Modeling, Computer Vision, NLP, Reinforcement Learning, Hypothesis Testing, A/B Testing, Topic Modeling, Recommendation Systems, Generative Modeling, Bayesian Modeling, and Neural Networks.

I firmly believe in lifelong learning and continue to explore new technologies and methodologies to stay on the cutting edge of data science.

## 💼 Experience

Currently, I am working as an Advanced Data Analytics Intern at Graybar. My role involves active development of solutions such as a freight cost estimator model using tools like Azure ML Studio, PowerBI, Snowflake, Azure Databricks, and PySpark.

Earlier in my career, I also had the opportunity to work as a Software Development Engineer at Walmart Global Tech, where I developed features for compliance audit-based supplier facing dashboards using React, Apache Airflow, HANA SQL and Spring Boot REST API.

## 💻 Technologies & Tools

I have gained proficiency in a wide array of programming languages and libraries:

#### Programming Languages:
`Python` `Java` `JavaScript` `C++` `R`

#### Libraries/Frameworks:
`NumPy` `Pandas` `SciPy` `Matplotlib` `PySpark` `Plotly` `Scikit-learn` `Keras` `TensorFlow` `ggplot2` `PyTorch` `OpenCV` `dplyr`
